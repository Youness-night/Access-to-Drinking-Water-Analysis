# Access to Drinking Water Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This two-part integrated project investigates access to safe and affordable drinking water using data from the WHO/UNICEF JMP (Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene) Estimates on the use of water dataset. The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Understanding the Data
1. Becoming familiar with the dataset
2. Importing the data
3. Investigating population size
4. Investigating access by area
5. Investigating access by population size
6. Investigating access by income group

### Part 2: Transforming the Data
1. Becoming familiar with the updated dataset
2. Investigating year representation
3. Investigating Annual Rates of Change (ARC)
4. Investigating access by area
5. Investigating access by region

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets for data analysis and visualization

## Key Objectives
1. Understand and import the datasets
2. Investigate global population size and urban/rural distribution
3. Analyze water access by area type (national, urban, rural)
4. Examine water access patterns based on population size and income groups
5. Calculate and analyze Annual Rates of Change (ARC) for water access
6. Investigate regional differences in water access improvement

## Data Sources
- WHO/UNICEF JMP Estimates on the use of water dataset for 2020
- WHO/UNICEF JMP Estimates on the use of water dataset from 2000 to 2020

## Key Concepts and Calculations
- Annual Rates of Change (ARC) for water access
- Population size and urbanization rates
- Income group classification
- Regional analysis of water access improvement

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and data analysis
- Advanced spreadsheet functions (IF statements, LOOKUP functions, error handling)
- Data visualization techniques
- Time series analysis (Annual Rates of Change)
- Regional and demographic analysis

## Challenges and Solutions
- Handling missing data and errors in the dataset
- Addressing outliers in population size data
- Calculating accurate Annual Rates of Change
- Combining datasets for regional analysis

## Key Insights
- Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in water access, with projections indicating full access may not be achieved until around 2080 at current rates of change.
- Rural areas generally show lower access to basic water services than urban areas, but some countries are making faster progress in rural areas.
